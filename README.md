# Snake Game

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2 as a 1 hour technical interview with Yopeso through WeAsWeb.

They thought it would be funny to build the snake game in Angular as an 1 hour exercise.

I have to admit, I panicked, I bargained, but with sweat and anxiety I eventually started working on it.

We've got a first functional version before the hour was up and I said I'll upload it to GitHub and make it public. Maybe even finish it up.

So here it is.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
